## Usage Notes
This tool was created as part of the [boot.dev](www.boot.dev/) curriculum as my first personal project.
There are undoubtedly more robust online tools for generating character sheets online, but this could still prove useful for any DM/GMs looking to *create simple sheets to help introduce brand-new players to the game*.
To ensure this project could be completed in a reasonable amount of time, a few things have been notably ommitted from FLF (AC, Spells, Feats, and statblocks for equipment).

Any omissions were made to ensure the project could be completed within 20-40 hours of time investment as per curriculum guidelines.
My suggestion? As a DM, you can use FLF to pre-generate sheets for players and fill-in/edit the output markdown files for your players to include more descriptive text and AC.
You can also introduce your players to online resources like [wikidot](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/) and include links in the generated sheets for players to reference.

Consider using FLF in a one-shot to teach players the basics of DND with a more rules-loose approach!
(Does it *really* matter how much damage a firebolt does when you're just trying to get your players to think about roleplay and using all the tools in their kit?
Save that for a real campaign!
